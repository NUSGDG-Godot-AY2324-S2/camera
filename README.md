# camera

Template project for creating a camera

## Guide

### Scenes

The following scenes have been implemented for you:

1. Map

The map is 3-layered, so that when the player falls down, the camera boundaries should change.

2. Player

Basic movement has been implemented: moving sideway and jump.

Assets are found in `/assets/Graphical Assets/sprites/player`.

### Layers

* Map: Layer 2, no mask
* Player: Layer 1, mask 2
